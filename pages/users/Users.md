# User Maintenance

Perform maintenance of users using the user maintenance screen.  Users can be searched, added, updated, and deleted on 
this form and users can be added to groups using the Groups list on the right of the form.

> [_TODO:_] __This page is enough to update the database tables but needs to be reworked once the design of the 
user/groups/roles have been completed.__
