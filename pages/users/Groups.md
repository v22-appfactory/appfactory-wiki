# Group Maintenance

Groups are maintained using the Group Maintenance screen.  Groups are a means of defining user sets that can be used in 
multiple applications and application roles.  Users are added to groups in the User Maintenance screen.

> [_TODO:_] __This page is enough to update the database tables but needs to be reworked once the design of the 
user/groups/roles have been completed.__
