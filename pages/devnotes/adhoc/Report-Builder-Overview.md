# Report Builder Overview

## Overview

The Report Builder provides a more constrained version of the Adhoc Query.  An administrator defines report templates
that define a subset of the data model in order to target specific queries.  The templates consist of columns that will
be supported for both display and conditions.  A default set of columns is provided, but columns can be added or removed
from the query results.
